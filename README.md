Live DJ
==========
Community-driven music sharing site, based on Telescope.

1. clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:GoodEveningMiss/live-dj.git`
2. IF you understand git, you can set up Telescope as a remote to pull and merge future changes
  * `cd live-dj & git remote add telescope git@github.com:TelescopeJS/Telescope.git`
  * overwrite push url for telescope remote to prevent accidental pushing to Telescope repo: `git remote set-url --push telescope no-pushing`
  * Telescope Documentation has a [useful page on updating](http://www.telesc.pe/docs/updating/)
  * I can give you collaborator access to [my Telescope fork](https://github.com/GoodEveningMiss/Telescope) if you want to work on upstream contributions together.
3. follow install directions at [Telescope Documentation](http://telesc.pe/docs)
  * you might have to run `meteor update` before running `meteor` as instructed at the end, to install the meteor packages before attempting to use them
  * you might have to change the permissions for the meteor packages installed: `chown -R YOURUSERNAME:YOURUSERNAME ~/.meteor/`
4. set up a branch for development/playing around
  * for yourself: `git checkout -b yourname-test`
  * for collaborating: `git fetch & git checkout -b development origin/development`
  * make sure you're pulling and pushing to the correct branches
5. IF you have stable code & have permission to push to the meteor repo (staging environment):
  * you will need to create an account on meteor.com and have me give you permission to push to the repo
  * `meteor deploy live-dj.meteor.com`
  * first time will require you to login w/ email and password when you deploy
6. Modulus currently doesn't support collaborators on projects, so let me know when you want to me to deploy to prod.


TELESCOPE
=========
Telescope is an open-source, real-time social news site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com)

**Note:** Telescope is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)
